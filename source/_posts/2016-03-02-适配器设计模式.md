## Adapter Pattern

A software developer, Max, has worked on an e-commerce website. The website allows users to shop and pay online. The site is integrated with a 3rd party payment gateway, through which users can pay their bills using their credit card. Everything was going well, until his manager called him for a change in the project.

>>  The manager told him that they are planning to change the payment gateway vendor, and he has to implement that in the code.
